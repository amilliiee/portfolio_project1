2_12 Notes

The player can choose an operation, but pressing cancel will make it invalid operation, causing the correctAnswer variable to be set to this.
Need to change instructions text to list what will happen.
Need to have the the game go to either the win or lose page depending on the score amount
Pressing next question on question 10 breifly shows question 11.  Should probably change that.
